# Dupe+
## Introduction
Introducing Dupe+ by the Dupe SMP Server called meme20200. Dupe+ Offers all the available things for a new dupe server.
## Skript Support
We believe that server owners need a wonderful experience while using our Minecraft Plugins. So we added Skript Support so like if you want to make a cow spawn whenever a player does `/dupe`.
## Slient-mode
The dupe command should be a slient command so people don't get frustrated on all the dupe messages.
(You can enable/disable this at anytime, its disabled by default)
